This is a sample project.
Stuff
More stuff.
Some meaningless info about this project.
And so on.
more stupid lines

We have three directories, modules, config, and data.
Each of them has a .gitignore file.

The purpose of .gitignore file is to list files that we want git to ignore when adding
files to repository and when checking for changes
